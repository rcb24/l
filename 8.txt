\section{Numbered theorems,definitions,corollaries and lemmas}
Theorems can easily be defined:

\begin{theorem}
let \(f\) be a function whose derivative exits in every point, then \(f\) is a continuous function.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[pythagorean theorem]
\label{pythagorean}
This is a theorem about right triangles and can be summarised in the next equation.
\[x^2+y^2=z^2\]
\end{theorem}

and a consequence of theorem \ref{pythagorean} is the statement in the corollary.

\begin{corollary}
there's  no right rectangle whose sides measure 3cm,4cm and 6cm.
\end{corollary}

you can reference theorem such as \ref{pythagorean}when a label is assigned.

\begin{lemma}
Given two line segments whose lengths are \(a\) and \(b\) respectively there is a real numbers \(r\) such that \(b=ra\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}[absolute value function]
The absolute value function can be specified as a two part definition as follows:\\
$
|x|=
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
x & \mbox{if} x >= 0\\
-x & \mbox{if} x < 0
\end{array}
\right.
$
\end{definition}
